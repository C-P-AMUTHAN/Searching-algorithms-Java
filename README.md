# Java Searching Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of commonly used searching algorithms in Java. Each algorithm is implemented with efficiency and clarity in mind, making it useful for both beginners and developers looking to integrate searching methods in their projects.

## Algorithms Included

- **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks each element one by one.
- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm that works on sorted arrays, using the divide and conquer approach.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/C-P-AMUTHAN/Searching-algorithms-Java.git
